Hi, I am a physicist and software engineer currently working at **Blue Yonder**. 

I did my PhD at the **University of Amsterdam**, working on Quantum Chromodynamics - the theory of the strong force - and collider physics. 

Afterwards, I moved to Hamburg to pursue a postdoc at **DESY**, where I worked on Standard Model predictions for the Higgs Boson for the **LHC at CERN**.
