Welcome! I'm Pedro â€” a software engineer and AI developer at **SAP Signavio**.

I began my journey in theoretical physics, earning a PhD from the **University of Amsterdam**, where I focused on Quantum Chromodynamics and collider physics. I then continued my research at **DESY** in Hamburg as a postdoctoral fellow, working on precise predictions for the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at **CERN**.

Following my postdoc, I chose to leave academia and have been working in the tech industry as a software engineer and AI developer since.
