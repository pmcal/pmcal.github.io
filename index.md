Hi, I am a physicist and software engineer currently working at Blue Yonder. 

I did my PhD at the University of Amsterdam, working on Quantum Chromodynamics - the theory of the strong force - and collider physics. I then moved to Hamburg, to pursue a postdoc at DESY, where I worked on Standard Model predictions for the Higgs Boson for the LHC at CERN.
