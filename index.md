Hello there, my name is Pedro Cal and I am software engineer currently working at **Blue Yonder**.

My background is in theoretical physics. I did my PhD at the **University of Amsterdam**, where my research focused on Quantum Chromodynamics - the theory of the strong force - and collider physics. 

Afterwards, I moved to Hamburg to pursue a postdoc at **DESY**, where I worked on Standard Model predictions for the Higgs Boson at the **LHC at CERN**. 

After my postdoc I decided to leave academia for the tech industry. Nowadays I work as a software engineer, with strong interest in machine learning & data science.
